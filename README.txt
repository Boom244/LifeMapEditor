Okay, so a few things:
The parser works line by line so each line of the 
text file has to have four values comma seperated like:
10,10,250,205
Secondly, if you run it from the command line, you can use an 
argument with it. e.g:
"py MapReader.py C:/path/to/your/MapFile.txt"
or else, it defaults to the MapFile in the same directory.
